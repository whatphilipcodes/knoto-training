It is part of the Town of Twillingate.\n\nIt was a farming and fishing village that had two stores and two schoolhouses in 1911. It had a population of 137 in 1956.\n\nBack Harbour is located on the Northern Twillingate Island, near other towns including Wild Cove, Crow Head and Twillingate. The town basically consists of two main streets, along with some side streets. The town is completely residential, except for a trailer park and a cottage.\n\nIn 1967 a major archeological find was made in Back Harbour. Multiple items that had been used by the Maritime Archaic people were found at dwellings and burial sites. Among the items were stone tools and grindstones, as well as artifacts showing evidence of burnt offerings.\n\nSee also \n Little Harbour, Newfoundland and Labrador\n Durrell, Newfoundland and Labrador\n Bayview, Newfoundland and Labrador\n List of communities in Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nPopulated coastal places in Canada\nPopulated places in Newfoundland and Labrador'}

It is expressed as the ratio of the core mass to the total mass of the core and envelope. Estimates of the limit depend on the models used and the assumed chemical compositions of the core and envelope; typical values given are from 0.10 to 0.15 (10% to 15% of the total stellar mass).  This is the maximum to which a helium-filled core can grow, and if this limit is exceeded, as can only happen in massive stars, the core collapses, releasing energy that causes the outer layers of the star to expand to become a red giant. It is named after the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Mario Schönberg, who estimated its value in a 1942 paper. They estimated it to be \n\nThe Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit comes into play when fusion in a main-sequence star exhausts the hydrogen at the center of the star.  The star then contracts until hydrogen fuses in a shell surrounding a helium-rich core, both of which are surrounded by an envelope consisting primarily of hydrogen.  The core increases in mass as the shell burns its way outwards through the star.  If the star's mass is less than approximately 1.5 solar masses, the core will become degenerate before the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit is reached, and, on the other hand, if the mass is greater than approximately 6 solar masses, the star leaves the main sequence with a core mass already greater than the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit so its core is never isothermal before helium fusion.  In the remaining case, where the mass is between 1.5 and 6 solar masses, the core will grow until the  limit is reached, at which point it will contract rapidly until helium starts to fuse in the core.\n\nReferences\n\nAstrophysics\nStellar astronomy\nStellar dynamics"}
